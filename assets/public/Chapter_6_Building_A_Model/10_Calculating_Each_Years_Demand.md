## Calculating Each Year's Demand

We know that each year's price is a decision variable. To simplify our model we will assume Le Napoleon assigns a Year 1 price and thereafter price grows by the same percentage (5%) each year.

Initially we will assume a Year 1 price (p) of $3.00. For simplicity, we will assume each year's demand is a linear demand curve of the form


```
[math]
\[Year\ 1\ demand\  = \ a\  - \ bp\]
```

This is probably unrealistic because if price is sufficiently large this equation predicts negative demand. Despite this fact, many analysts utilize a linear demand curve. Many analysts also assume 
`
[math]
\(demand\  = \ ap - b\)
`
. This is called the power or constant elasticity demand curve.

How can we determine a and b for our demand curve?

The parameter a is simply the estimated annual demand if we chose a price of $0. Let's suppose 420,000 pastries.

The parameter b is our estimated loss in annual demand if we increase the price by $1. We will assume 
`
[math]
\(b\  = \ 60,000\)
`
.

Placing the values of a and b in cells rather than directly in formulas will make it easy to change the values of a and b and determine how this impacts the bakery's projected viability.

For demand after year 1 we will use a two-stage growth model. We assume that demand will grow at a rather large rate (say 15%) for a given number of years (say 5). Thereafter the annual growth rate in demand will reach a reduced or "steady state" level which is a given fraction (say 1/3) of the initial growth rate.

Let us calculate the demand for Year 1 and then determine the demand growth rate after year 1

### Step 1: Using the above data, let us fill in the inputs and decision variables for our spreadsheet model that we started building in Section 6.7. 

Year 1 selling price (p)

Year 1 demand intercept (a)

Year 1 demand slope (b)

Number of years till demand steady state

Beginning growth rate for demand

Steady state level of demand as a percentage of the initial growth rate

Annual price increase

```

### Step 2: Calculate Steady state growth rate in Cell D11 (beginning growth rate \* steady state level of demand)

Help: Multiply the beginning growth rate D9 with D10, the steady state level of demand as a percentage of the beginning growth rate.

```

### Step 3: Now letâ€™s begin calculating our outputs. Calculate Demand for year 2013 (in Cell E21) (using, demand = a - bp)

Help: Enter the 2013 demand as, 420,000 minus 60,000 times price, by entering in cell E20 the formula, equals year one demand intersect minus year one demand slope times D5

```

### Step 4: Let us calculate the Demand Growth rate for Year 2014 - 2022.

```
[cosmatt-widget]
 {"type":"spreadsheet-DLSleonardo-v2","options":{"data":{"itemId":"leo-leonardo-demo-185","meta":{"renderOverrides":{}}}}} 
```

Help: In cell F19, compute the 2014 demand growth with the formula, 
`
[math]
\(= if\ (F16\  < = \ years\ till\ demand\ steady\ state\  + \ 1,\ beginning\ growth\ rate,\ steady\ state\ growth\ rate)\)
`
 or using the following formula, 
`
[math]
\(= if(F16 < = \ \$ D8 + 1,\$ D9,\ \$ D11\)
`
). Recall from a prior section that a $ sign before the row of a cell reference ensures that when we copy the formula the row reference remains unchanged. Similarly, a $ sign before the number in a cell reference ensures that when we copy the formula, the column reference remains unchanged.

As long as we are in the fast growth phase, demand grows by 15%. After the fast growth phase is over, demand grows by 5%. Copying this formula to the range G19 through N19 generates the growth rate in demand through 2022.
